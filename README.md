# Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) Platform

## 🚀 Overview
Our **Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) Platform** leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict the **bioactivity of chemical drugs** (medicines) at their target **protein sites** in the body. 

By integrating computational methods, we reduce the **time** and **cost** spent on inactive molecules during the research and development process, increasing the overall **success ratio** of drug discovery.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Molecular Bioactivity Prediction**: Calculate molecular bioactivity and descriptors.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Work with peers in a shared research environment.
- **Search & Retrieve Results**: Access past computational analyses and results.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Save and share results with your team.
- **Patent Filing Requests**: Initiate patent filing directly from the platform.
